<p>
<strong>jpaul</strong> is a Java implementation of several algorithms
that are widely used in program analysis.  Compiler writers often
reimplement a (relatively small) set of algorithms: graph algorithms,
dataflow engines, set constraint solvers etc.  The goal of the
<strong>jpaul</strong> project is to have these algorithms implemented
independently of any compiler infrastructure project.
<strong>jpaul</strong> emphasizes (in order): correctness,
flexibility, ease-of-use, and asymptotic complexity (we are not very
interested in cutting-edge low level optimizations).  The intended
audience consists of program analysis researchers in need of a
correct, elegant, and fast way of prototyping their analysis ideas.

<p>
<strong>jpaul</strong> is implemented in Generic Java (<a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/index.jsp">JDK 1.5</a>); you
don't need any other package in order to use <strong>jpaul</strong>.
For development, <strong>jpaul</strong> has very common dependencies:
<a href="http://ant.apache.org">ant</a> and
<a href="http://junit.org">junit</a>.

<p>
The entire code is released under the terms of the <a
href="COPYING.html">(Modified) BSD Licence</a>.  In the spirit of
scientific honesty, researchers who use <strong>jpaul</strong> are
encouraged to acknowledge <strong>jpaul</strong> explicitly in their
scientific publications; here is a 
<a href="jpaul-bibtex.txt">suggested BibTeX entry</a>.

<a name="current-features"><h2>Current Features</h2></a>

<ul>

<li>Graph algorithms - package <a
href="javadoc/jpaul/Graphs/package-summary.html#package_description">jpaul.Graphs</a>:

<ul>

<li>Generic definition of a directed graph (digraph) as a set of
<i>root</i> vertices and a <i>navigator</i> that describes the arcs of
the graph.  This design allows the use of our library even for graphs
whose arcs are not explicitly stored in the vertices.

<li>General digraph algorithms: dfs traversals, reachability, shortest
paths, etc.

<li>Strongly connected components (SCCs): given a digraph, we can
construct its topologically sorted component digraph - a digraph whose
vertices are the SCCs of the original graph.

<li>Basic block representation of a digraph.

<li>Directed binary trees (special digraphs).  Utilities for iterating
efficiently over such trees in pre-/in-/post-order.

</ul>


<p>
<li>Generic and efficient solver for systems of inequality constraints
over lattices - package <a
href="javadoc/jpaul/Constraints/package-summary.html#package_description">jpaul.Constraints</a>.
Generalization of classical set constraint solvers.  Allows the user
to define its own kinds of constraints.  As an example of the
constraint solver framework, we also implemented a set constraint
solver - package <a
href="javadoc/jpaul/Constraints/SetConstraints/package-summary.html#package_description">jpaul.Constraints.SetConstraints</a>.

<p>
<li>Generic NFAs and regular expressions - package <a
href="javadoc/jpaul/RegExps/package-summary.html#package_description">jpaul.RegExps</a>:

<ul>

<li>Conversion from NFA to regular expressions

</ul>

<p>
<li>Useful data structures - package <a
href="javadoc/jpaul/DataStructs/package-summary.html#package_description">jpaul.DataStructs</a>:

<ul>

<li>Binary and ternary relations

<li>Classes for the factory pattern

<li>Copy-on-write data structures

<li>Work sets for fixed-point computations

</ul>


<p>
<li>Other goodies - package <a
href="javadoc/jpaul/Misc/package-summary.html#package_description">jpaul.Misc</a>

</ul>



<a name="getting-started"><h2>Getting Started</h2></a>

<ul>

<li><strong>Easiest way:</strong> To use <strong>jpaul</strong>, it
suffices to download the <code>jpaul-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i>.jar</code>
file and add it to your CLASSPATH.  Click <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=131236">here</a>
for the download site.

<p>
<strong>Note for Eclipse users</strong> (courtesy <a
href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/akiezun">Adam Kiezun</a>)<strong>:</strong> you may
add the downloaded <code>.jar</code> file to your Eclipse project, select the
<code>.jar</code> and choose "<code>Build Path</code> &nbsp; &gt;
&nbsp; <code>Add
to Build Path</code>" from the context menu.  This will allow you to
use the <strong>jpaul</strong> code and also to see the
<strong>jpaul</strong> code you're using in Eclipse.

<p>
Alternatively, if you want to do changes inside
<strong>jpaul</strong>, you may download the file
<code>jpaul-<i>&lt;version&gt;</i>-src.zip</code> from <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=131236">here</a>.
It contains all files of the project, including
<code>jpaul.jar</code>, Java source files, Javadoc, tests, etc.

<p>
<li>Anonymous (read-only) CVS access to the source code:<br><br>
<tt>
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jpaul co jpaul<br>
</tt><br>
Press Enter if prompted for a password.


<p>
<li>Full developer CVS access: First, make yourself an account on <a
href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>, and contact the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/users/salcianu/">project admin</a> (Alex
Salcianu) to obtain the right to edit the source.  Next, you can
start with the following commands:<br><br>
<tt>
export CVS_RSH=ssh<br>
cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jpaul co
jpaul<br>
</tt><br>

</ul>

<a name="users"><h2>Projects that use <strong>jpaul</strong></h2></a>

<ul>

<li>Alex Salcianu uses <strong>jpaul</strong> extensively in the <a
href="http://jppa.sourceforge.net">jppa</a> (Java Pointer and Purity
Analysis) project.  In particular, <strong>jpaul</strong> was used to
reimplement an inter-procedural, compositional pointer analysis for
Java.  The implementation using <strong>jpaul</strong> is not only
cleaner and more flexible, but also faster than the original one: the
constraint solver from <strong>jpaul</strong> has a better grasp on
the "big picture" and can perfom optimizations that were impossible in
the original implementation.

<p>
<li><a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/akiezun">Adam Kiezun</a> uses
the graph package of <strong>jpaul</strong> in a project that performs
generics-related refactorings in Eclipse - see his <a
href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/akiezun/de05-kiezun.pdf">OOPSLA'05
demo</a>.  An early adopter, Adam has been a happy user of
<strong>jpaul</strong> ever since :)

<p>
<li>Please drop <a href="mailto:salcianu@#@alum.mit.edu">me</a> an
email if you are a <strong>jpaul</strong> user.  I would be happy to
hear your feedback and list your project here!

</ul>

<a name="team"><h2>The <strong>jpaul</strong> Team</h2></a>

<strong>jpaul</strong> was started by <a
href="http://www.mit.edu/~salcianu">Alex Salcianu</a> in February
2005.  <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/akiezun/">Adam Kiezun</a>
provided many useful comments and formally joined the
<strong>jpaul</strong> team in January 2006.


<a name="ack"><h2>Acknowledgements</h2></a>

<strong>jpaul</strong> contains pieces of code contributed by the
following people: <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~suhabe/">Suhabe
Bugrara</a> (the initial version of the <code>RegExps</code> package),
<a href="http://www-faculty.cs.uiuc.edu/~marinov/">Darko Marinov</a>
(the Emacs <code>prj.el</code> script) and <a
href="http://cscott.net">C. Scott Ananian</a> (the initial versions of
<code>ReverseListIterator</code> and <code>UnionFind</code>).  Some of
the code from this project was initially developed for the <a
href="http://www.flex-compiler.lcs.mit.edu/">MIT FLEX</a> compiler
infrastructure.
