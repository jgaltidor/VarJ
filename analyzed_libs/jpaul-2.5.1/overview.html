<b>jpaul</b> is a collection of generic implementations of several
algorithms widely used in program analysis.

After a few years in compiler research, it is hard not to notice that
compiler researchers spend a lot of their time re-implementing a
very small set of algorithms: graph traversals, construction of
strongly-connected components, fixpoint solvers, set-constraint
solvers, dataflow solvers, etc.  The goal of the
<b>jpaul</b> project is to provide a generic implementation of these
algorithms, separated from any specific compiler infrastructure.

<code>jpaul</code> are encouraged to acknowledge this fact explicitly
in their scientific publications.
