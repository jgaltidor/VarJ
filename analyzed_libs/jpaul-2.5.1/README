jpaul - Java Program Analysis Utilities Library

INSTALLATION FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES
=====================================

To build the jpaul sources, you need the following tools:

1. JDK 1.5 or later
   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/index.jsp

2. Apache Ant
   http://ant.apache.org

3. JUnit 2.0 or later
   http://junit.sourceforge.net

   VERY IMPORTANT: we currently use junit 3.8.1.  We've placed the
   relevant junit.jar in the lib/ subdirectory and we strongly
   recommend you to place this .jar on your CLASSPATH.  Unfortunately,
   we've been unable to edit our ant build.xml file to make the junit
   ant task work without this update to the CLASSPATH environment
   variable; hopefully, one day ant will improve its support of junit.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

After you change the sources, you can use ant to build them, perform
testing, generate documentation, package relevant classfiles in a .jar
etc.  To find out the possible ant targets in the build.xml file, just
execute

  ant -projecthelp
